## About

These are scripts for [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/).

### Installation: 
Put the scripts into Scripts folder: Library – Application Support - Glyphs - Scripts
(Cmd + Shift + Y)

### Shortcuts

The idea of Align scripts is that you can align nodes and handles with keyboard shortcuts and save a lot of time. I personally use Ctrl + Cmd + Arrow keys. Set it in System Preferences – Keyboard – Shortcuts.

Note: I can’t really write scripts from scratch, so *Align* is just a modified version of *Distribute Nodes* by [Mekkablue](https://github.com/mekkablue/Glyphs-Scripts).
