## About

These are scripts for [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/).

### Installation: 
Put the scripts into Scripts folder: Library – Application Support - Glyphs - Scripts
(Cmd + Shift + Y)

### Align, Reflect and Rotate

Align and reflect nodes and handles. Useful with keyboard shortcuts — I personally use Ctrl + Cmd + Arrow keys. Set it in System Preferences – Keyboard – Shortcuts.

### Preferred Names
Sets (or cleans) *preferredFamily* and *preferredSubfamily* instance custom parameters. Based on *Font Family Name* and *Instance / Style Name*. Useful for office apps compatibility.

### Dark Mode
Toggles dark mode on and off.

### Demo Instance Generator
Generates instances with limited character set (customizable) from active instances. Adds “Demo” suffix, removes features and OT classes depending on the character set.

### Text Filter
Removes all characters from a text, except selected ones. Useful for testing WIP fonts with limited character set.
